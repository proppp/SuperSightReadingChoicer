# SuperSightReadingChoicer

Have you got a stupidly big collection of sheet music and
want to sight read it randomly? This program is for you!
It chooses a random (pdf) file and keeps track of it. Then
you can decide whether you wanna rank it (noteworthy, difficult)
so you can have another look at it in the future.
A file that's already been chosen will not be chosen again.
This way, you will eventually sight read your whole collection
(and remember which pieces were too difficult/noteworthy,
so you can compare with your past self).


## Usage

### Linux
im too lazy to build it properly, just run

    python3 main.py
  
### Windows
just execute SuperSightReadingChoicer.exe found in Releases

### macOS
throw away your computer

## Warning

This program is poorly written and it'd make no sense to continue its developement.
That said, I personally use it everyday and it gets the job done. Use at your own risk ^_^
